# 42 cursus ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() arenâ€™t enough.

The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??

It is actually pretty cool :)

## Requirements
The prototype for the function must be:
``` C
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
```
### Mandatory
You have to implement the following conversions:
* `%c` Prints a single character.
* `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
* `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
* `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
* `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
* `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
* `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
* `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
* `%%` Prints a percent sign.

### Bonus
* Manage any combination of the following flags: `-0.` and the field minimum width under all conversions.
* Manage all the following flags: `# +` (Yes, one of them is a space).


## Development
### Syntax
The syntax for every format specifier is:
```
%[flags][width][.precision][length]specifier
```
### Flags
Since multiple flags may be used, their behaviour must be able to be merged into them. To do so, flags need a `group[s]` and a `priority` in it.
* `priority` is an int from `0` to `n`.
#### `-`
Justifies the result to the left within the given field `width`. So padding will be at the right.
Ignored if `width` is not provided.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>  `0` is a `padding flag` and has **priority 1**.

**By default,** result is justified to the right. So padding will be at the left.
#### `0`
Sets padding value to `0`.

**By default,** padding value is a space.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
>  `0` is a `padding flag` and has **priority 0**.
